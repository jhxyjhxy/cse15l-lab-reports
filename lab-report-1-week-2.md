Overall, make sure you have at least 6 screenshots, one for each of the steps below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did.

## 1. Installing VSCode
> Start by going to the Visual Studio Code's website ([Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)) to find instructions to download and install it on your system. After successfully installing VSCode, you should have a window similar to the picture below!

## 2. Remotely Connecting
> Since CSE 15L (and many other courses) requires us to connect remotely often, we should learn to use the `ssh` command. First, you need to install the OpenSSH program ([Install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)) and follow the instructions to set it up for your system.

Next, using a VSCode terminal, type the following command (replacing the `cs15lwi22asz` with your account):
<br><br>
`ssh cs15lwi22asz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
<br><br>
There will most likely be a message asking if you're sure you want to connect, since it is your first time connecting to this server. Since you do want to, type `yes`, and press the enter key. Enter your password when prompted, then the terminal will output something like this:
